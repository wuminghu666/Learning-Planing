# [Forecasting at Scale](https://facebookincubator.github.io/prophet/)

*NB*: Facebook's new open source time series project. I think it's aimed to be a general-purpose tool, with uncertainty, seasonal decomposition, filling missing data. It's very easy to use, while it gives very limited power to do specific modeling. It's based on Stan, or PyStan, to make probabilistic forecasting. It's unfair to compare it with some other specific approaches to model particular time series, but I tested it on my project, and it gave much poorer results. I think the reason is that Prophet has very limited power to model non-linearity, since it uses time as the very unique regressor, as mentioned in its paper. Prophet should be a good tool to make long-term forecasting, but it't bad at providing accurate short-term forecasting. Anyway, it's a good tool for time series analysis.
